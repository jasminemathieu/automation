## Introduction

This project demonstrates the streamlined process of designing and implementing AWS policies to enhance security and control over AWS services.

### Components used to complete this project:

- Amazon web services (AWS)
  - AWS Policy Generator 
  - AWS IAM
- JSON

## Select Policy Type:
Begin by choosing the type of policy to suit your requirements. For this project, we will choose an IAM Policy.

We will use a Bucket from the Amazon AWS S3 console. For this project I will use a test bucket titled 'testmybuckets300963723832'. Click on the bucket's name to open it.

Select the Properties tab within the bucket and copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

## Select AWS Service:
Navigate back to the AWS Policy Generator tool. Select ALLOW for the policy Effect. Note: AWS automatically defaults all policies Effect to DENY unless changed. 

For this project, we'll use Amazon S3 as our AWS Service and select the following Actions: GetObject, ListBucket, and PutObject. After your selections, the Actions should read '3 Action(s) Selected'. 

Then paste the copied ARN into the AWS Policy Generator's ARN field.
